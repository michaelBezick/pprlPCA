Problems:
------------------------------

1. need tripod camera + multi camera fusion with maniskill environment, probably can do similar code to sofaenv

2. it looks like the current method of instantiating the train and eval cages has some weird effects (might be fixed now not sure)
it would be nice to have a self.mode variable within

class SofaEnvPointCloudObservations(gym.ObservationWrapper):

that indicates train and eval modes. I've had issues getting the parameters I want passed into this, so investigating the best
way to instantiate cages is useful.

In the past, I've also tried just instantiating it the original way (check original repo), but this produced a very weird
bug where the 3 point clouds were linearly misaligned.

3. code cleanup for supplying parameters with config files
